################################Analysis of Culex Perexiguus & Anopheles troparvus:
#Comparing Univariate probit models with multivariate probit models. Procedure:
#1. Data preparation
#2. Fitting the most complex models (all environmental covariates 
#+ according interaction and quadratic terms): a. probit Culex, b. Probit Anopheles
#c. multivariate probit Anopheles & Culex
#3. Internal Model validation of these models by analyzing its residuals with DHARMa
#4. Selecting the "best" model by using WAIC on the univariate probit models
#>> Finding the "most appropriate" specifications of covariates
#5. Redoing the internal validation for the "most appropriate" model.
#6. Results
#6.1. In-sample:
#a. Comparing the coefficients: Size and credibility intervals
#b. Response Curves
#c. Variable importance
#d. Residual Correlation Parameter of gjam
#6.2. Out-of-Sample
#a. Conditional Predictions of gjam vs. Unconditional Predictions of 
#gjam vs. predictions of univariate model
#b. Comparing the uncertainty of the different "prediction"-types

#### 1.Data Preperation
#read in the data (Monthly species PA data for seven different mosquito species
#and according environmental covariates)
df <- read_excel("MonthlyData.xlsx")

#Checking the rough structure of the data set
str(df)
summary(df$Fecha) # Dates in 2006 dont make any sense. I assume that they put by
#accident 2006 instead of 2010. So I change these dates
df$Fecha <- as.POSIXct(sub("2006", "2010", df$Fecha))

#Transform "Mes" (month when record was taken) into a factor variable
df$Mes <- factor(df$Mes, levels =c("Abril", "Mayo", "Junio", "Julio", "Agosto",
                                   "Septiembre"))

#Reading in the spatial coordinates of the different trap locations
coords <- read_excel("Traps_coordenadas_geograficas.xls")

#Trap and Area mean the same thing, so we change the name in df from "area" to "trap"
names(df)[names(df)=="Area"] <- "trap"
#Canada is spelt differently, so I change the spelling in df to "Cañada"
df[,"trap"] <- lapply(df[,"trap"], gsub, pattern = "Ca?da", replacement = "Cañada",
                      fixed = T)

#adding lon-lat column to the data frame df
df <- merge(df, coords[, c("trap", "Norte", "Oeste")], by="trap", all.x= T, sort = F)

#Selecting our two species (Perexiguus & Anopheles troparvus) for the analysis. Our
#rationale is to select the two species that roughly occur in 50 % of the observations
#in order to get the maximum variation. We ignore the column "An_atroparvus", 
#because it does not seem to be PA-data (rather abundance data).

#extract the PA data for all species
spec <- df[,7:14]
#deleting the An_atroparvus column
spec[,"An_atroparvus"] <- NULL
#Taking a look at occurence rate across all observations (the Mean)
summary(spec)
#Hence, we select Cxperpre and Anatropre for our first analysis:
y <- spec[,c("Cxperpre", "Anatropre")]

#Normalizing Covariates: Otherwise, interaction terms hardy interpretable and skewed
df[,17:36] <- scale(df[,17:36])

#Split the data set in training (70 %) and test (30%) set
train_size <- floor(0.7 * nrow(y))
#set a random seed for replicability
set.seed(333)
#sample the training IDs
train_id <- sample(seq_len(nrow(y)), size = train_size)

#partition data into train and test set
train <- df[train_id, ]
test <- df[-train_id, ]
y_train <- y[train_id, ]
y_test <- y[-train_id, ]

####Fitting the most complex models
#The covariates Inundation Area and NDVI are available on different spatial and
#temporal scales. For the temporal scales, I include both scales (current +
#month before) in the analyis. For the spatial scale, I select one of the five
#alternatives (100 m buffer, 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m and 2000m). I decided which scale
#to choose on the basis of the models in Roiz's paper. He already has "the most
#appropriate" specifications for his Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) with a 
#binomial error distribution and binomial link function for Culex Perexiguus & 
#Anopheles troparvus. So, for example since he used "NDVI_500" for his Culex perexiguus
#model, I use also the "NDVI_500" in all my models. Justifications for my choice of 
#spatial scales:
#IA_500: In Roiz's Culex Perexiguus model
#NDVI_500: In Roiz's Culex Perexiguus model
#IABEF_2000: In contrast to IA_500, because this way we reduce the expected 
#collinearity between  IA_500 and IABEF_2000 >> "maximum variation
#NDVIBEF_2000: In Roiz's Anopheles model

#a. fitting the model for Culex Perexiguus
fit_cp <- stan_glm(Cxperpre ~ (IA_500 + NDVI_500 + IABEF_2000 + NDVIBEF_2000)^2 +
                     Mes + I(IA_500^2) + I(NDVI_500^2) + I(IABEF_2000^2) +
                     I(NDVIBEF_2000^2), data = train,
                   family = binomial(link = "probit"),init_r = .7, seed = 333)

#b. fitting the model for Anopheles
fit_at <- stan_glm(Anatropre ~ (IA_500 + NDVI_500 + IABEF_2000 + NDVIBEF_2000)^2 + 
                     Mes + I(IA_500^2) + I(NDVI_500^2) + I(IABEF_2000^2) +
                     I(NDVIBEF_2000^2), data = train,
                   family = binomial(link = "probit"),init_r = .7, seed = 333)

#1. Step: Removing entire covariates and their associated terms (interactions and 
#quadratic)
x <- fit_cp
#x: fitted model for which coefficients should be dropped
#y: names of the covariates ()
y <- c(names(fit_cp$coefficients)[2:5], "Mes")
step_waic_entCov <- function(x, y){
  waic_base <- waic(x) #the baseline WAIC to which the more parsimonious models will 
  #be compared (It's always the "Most" complex model at the specific point of the 
  #model-selection procedure)
  #Create an empty list to store the WAICs of the different models
  st <- list()
