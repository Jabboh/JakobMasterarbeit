#You can see that there is a positive linear relationship between the predictions
#of the two models grouped by the PA of Anopheles troparvus (the species we conditioned on).
#This indicates that both models roughly do the same/environmental signals are treated 
#similarily. The slopes of the two lines are a little less than  1 (we would expect 1, right?).
#We can still the very slight effect that the univariate models tends to predict extremer values.
#Or is this just by chance?
#You can see that the conditioning on Anopheles troparvus has a 
#clear effect (The blue and red points form two distinct groups) on the multivariate 
#predictions compared to the univariate predictions. The multivariate model predicts a roughly
#12.5 % points higher probability of occurence for plots where Anopheles troparvus is present 
#compared to plots where it's absent.
